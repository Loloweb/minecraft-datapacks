This is a patch I made to Vanilla Tweaks' Cauldron Concrete that fixes it not working for 1.21.11. It replaces the `modifier` variable with `on_pass`, a change that happened in snapshot 25w43a.

While the original developers of Vanilla Tweak have patched it themselves since then, I leave it here for historical purposes as this is pretty much my first foray into the world of Minecraft Datapacks.
